# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the deployment issues with the healthcare chatbot application on Render. The application works perfectly in local development but fails with "Error connecting to server" when deployed to Render. The solution involves configuring proper deployment settings, build processes, and environment-specific configurations to ensure seamless deployment on Render's platform.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Flask backend to properly start on Render's platform, so that the API endpoints are accessible to the frontend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is deployed to Render THEN the Flask app SHALL start using the PORT environment variable provided by Render
2. WHEN the Flask app starts THEN it SHALL bind to host 0.0.0.0 and the dynamic port assigned by Render
3. WHEN the deployment process runs THEN it SHALL install all Python dependencies from requirements.txt
4. IF the PORT environment variable is not set THEN the app SHALL fallback to port 5050 for local development

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the React frontend to be properly built and served during deployment, so that users can access the web interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the deployment process runs THEN it SHALL automatically build the React frontend using npm run build
2. WHEN the build completes THEN the Flask app SHALL serve the built React files from the build directory
3. WHEN users access any frontend route THEN the Flask app SHALL serve the React app's index.html file
4. WHEN the React app makes API calls THEN it SHALL use the correct base URL for the deployed environment

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper deployment configuration files, so that Render knows how to build and start the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the repository is deployed THEN Render SHALL find a build command that installs dependencies and builds the frontend
2. WHEN the build completes THEN Render SHALL find a start command that runs the Flask application
3. WHEN deployment fails THEN the configuration SHALL provide clear error messages and debugging information
4. WHEN the application starts THEN all required model files SHALL be accessible and loadable

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want environment-specific configurations, so that the application behaves correctly in both development and production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running in production THEN the app SHALL use production-optimized settings
2. WHEN running in development THEN the app SHALL use development settings with debug mode
3. WHEN the React app determines the environment THEN it SHALL use the appropriate API base URL
4. WHEN CORS is configured THEN it SHALL allow requests from the deployed frontend domain

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the chatbot to work seamlessly after deployment, so that I can get disease predictions and medicine recommendations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I submit symptoms through the deployed interface THEN the prediction API SHALL return accurate disease predictions
2. WHEN the API processes my request THEN it SHALL return appropriate medicine recommendations
3. WHEN there are API errors THEN the frontend SHALL display meaningful error messages
4. WHEN I interact with the chatbot THEN the authentication system SHALL work correctly in the deployed environment
