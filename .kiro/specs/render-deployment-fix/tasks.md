# Implementation Plan

- [ ] 1. Create Render deployment configuration files

  - Create build.sh script that installs dependencies and builds React frontend
  - Create start.sh script that launches Flask app with proper port configuration
  - Make scripts executable and ensure proper error handling
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [ ] 2. Modify Flask app for production deployment

  - Update app.py to use dynamic PORT environment variable from Render
  - Add environment detection for production vs development settings
  - Configure CORS settings for deployed domain
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.4, 4.1, 4.4_

- [x] 3. Fix React frontend API configuration

  - Update Chatbot.js to use correct base URL for production environment
  - Remove hardcoded production URL and use relative paths for same-origin requests
  - Ensure API calls work in both development and production environments
  - _Requirements: 2.4, 4.3, 5.3_

- [x] 4. Verify and update dependencies

  - Check requirements.txt contains all necessary Python packages
  - Ensure package.json has correct build scripts and dependencies
  - Add any missing dependencies for production deployment
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 2.1, 3.4_

- [x] 5. Test deployment configuration locally
  - Test build script execution and verify React build generation
  - Test Flask app startup with PORT environment variable
  - Verify static file serving works correctly
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 2.3, 5.1, 5.2_
